# Fixing code errors - NodeJs

### ðŸ’» About the challenge


In this challenge, we have a Node.js application that is in the development process but that already has the necessary tests to do all the validation of the requirements (you shouldn't mess with the tests).
After some changes in the application code, part of the tests failed and now only you can solve this problem. Let's go? 

This application performs the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) of project repositories. In addition, it is possible to give likes to registered repositories, increasing the number of likes by 1 each time the route is called.

Next we will see in more detail what and how it needs to be done ðŸš€
